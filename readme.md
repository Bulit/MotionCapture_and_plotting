# Motion capture app with graph

## Run with main.py

App let you set up your camera as motion detector that save motion start and end to CSV file and create html graph to visualize it in time. In addition to that every movement that occur on your cam will be recorded from the moment of traspasing camera sight. Every movement are saved on new *.avi file.
